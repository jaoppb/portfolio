# About Me

I am a Software Engineer student at _Pontifícia Universidade Católica de Minas Gerais_. Currently at my bachelor's degree fourth semester, I were an academic monitor of _Algoritmo e Estrutura de Dados I_ at first half of 2025 and now I am actuating as an academic monitor of _Algoritmo e Estrutura de Dados II_ at the second half of 2025.

I like reading and believes that books contributes largely for my technical development; and every time that is possible I manage to read to help my studies.

Going more personal, I like games, including: Minecraft, Rocket League, Balatro, Idle Factory, Portal 1 e 2, Slime Rancher, Grand Theft Auto V, Fortnite, Brawlhalla e etc.
