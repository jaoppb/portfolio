# Portfolio Front-End

That folder contains everything needed to run the front end application of the Portfolio project

## How To Run

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Now you can start it for development at `http://localhost:4200`:

```bash
npm run start
```

or, you can serve it:

```bash
npm run start:prod          # serve with express
npm run build               # compile it and serve with anything you want
npm run serve:ssr:portfolio # serve ssr after previous command
```

## Tests

You can also run the unit tests with:

```bash
npm run test
```

or, the e2e tests: (yet to add)

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```
